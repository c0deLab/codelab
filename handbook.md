# Introduction

Codelab at Carnegie Mellon University is a space for interdisciplinary research in architecture, design, computation, and interaction. Members of the lab include graduate students from the [Masters in Tangible Interaction Design (MTID)](http://soa.cmu.edu/mtid/), [Emerging Media Masters (EM2)](http://ideate.cmu.edu/graduate-programs-research/emerging-media/), and [Computational Design (MSCD)](http://soa.cmu.edu/computational-design/) programs.

We have a variety of digital and traditional fabrication and prototyping tools in our space, including a large laser cutter, a 3D printer, woodworking tools, a photographic documentation station, a sewing machine, and a fully equipped electronics bench.

We’re located in Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 403.

# Getting Started

## Orientation

At the beginning of the academic year all new members of Codelab undergo an orientation that includes training in safety and best practices and effective use of our tools.

## Trainings

#### EH&S-administered training

There are four safety trainings that are compulsory for members of Codelab which are administered by [Environmental Health and Safety](http://cmu.edu/ehs), a University office. They are:

* [Soldering Safety](https://cmu.bioraft.com/rafttraining/course/109)
* [Fire Extinguisher Use](https://cmu.bioraft.com/node/284572/sessions)
* [Hazard Communication](https://cmu.bioraft.com/node/284587/sessions)
* [Student Shop Safety](https://cmu.bioraft.com/rafttraining/course/103)

The Soldering Safety and Student Shop Safety trainings are completed online, and the Fire Extinguisher Use and Hazard Communication trainings require attendance at an in-person session.

[Bioraft](http://cmu.bioraft.com) is the University’s system for tracking and administering safety trainings. Log in to Bioraft to complete the web trainings and sign up for in-person trainings, or follow the links above to go straight to the relevant Bioraft pages.

#### Codelab-administered training

At the beginning of the academic year, Codelab members are trained on the safe and effective use of our major tools and facilities:

* Laser
* 3D Printer
* Wood Shop
* Electronics Bench
* Documentation Station

#Polices

## Lock the door and turn off the lights!

If you are the last person leaving the space, you’re responsible for locking the door and turning out the lights. Codelab members who don’t do this are exposing the whole lab to the possibility of damage or theft.

## Common Spaces
Codelab is lucky to have a large shared working area for collaboration, chatting, working on larger projects, etc. It’s only fair that people using the common area take responsibility for cleaning up any mess, returning tools and materials to where they belong, etc., and leaving the space ready to be used by the next person. Please be reasonable and respectful of all the other members of the space!

## Monitors
Each Codelab member has the option of borrowing one or two Dell G2210t 22” LED monitors and monitor stands to use during their time at the lab. Borrowed monitors must be returned in good condition at the end of a member’s tenure at Codelab.

## Desks
Codelab members get a work desk and shelving unit. Seniority is used to determine the order of choosing desks.

## Keys
Keys to Codelab are distributed to members who have completed all EH&S required safety trainings (see above for details on which trainings are compulsory). Members must return their keys at the end of their tenure at Codelab or the University will assess a $50 lost key fee.
